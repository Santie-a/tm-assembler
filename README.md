# TM Assembler for Minecraft (Inspired by Mattbatwings)

## Overview
This project provides a set of Python scripts to assemble and convert Turing Machine (TM) programs into Minecraft-compatible schematics. The assembler and schematic generator are designed for use with redstone computers in Minecraft, inspired by the work of [Mattbatwings](https://www.youtube.com/@Mattbatwings) and his redstone computer projects.

- This project adapts and extends concepts from Mattbatwings' [BatPU-2](https://https://github.com/mattbatwings/BatPU-2) and related redstone computer resources.

## Components

### 1. `assembler.py`
- **Purpose:** Converts TM assembly files (`.as`) into machine code files (`.mc`).
- **Usage:**
  ```powershell
  python assembler.py input.as output.mc
  ```
  - `input.as`: Your TM assembly source file.
  - `output.mc`: Output machine code file (default: `output.mc`).
- **Features:**
  - Supports custom TM assembly syntax.
  - Encodes states, symbols, and movements into binary.
  - Handles HALT and REJECT states.
  - Pads output to 256 lines (one for each possible state-symbol pair).

### 2. `schematic.py`
- **Purpose:** Converts machine code files (`.mc`) into Minecraft schematic files (`.schem`) for use with WorldEdit or similar tools.
- **Usage:**
  ```powershell
  python schematic.py input.mc output.schem
  ```
  - `input.mc`: Machine code file generated by the assembler.
  - `output.schem`: Output schematic file.
- **Features:**
  - Maps each instruction to a specific position in the schematic.
  - Uses repeaters and wool blocks to represent binary data.
  - Supports up to 1024 instructions.

### 3. `string_schem.py`
- **Purpose:** Converts a binary string (representing TM tape or input) into a Minecraft schematic for string input.
- **Usage:**
  ```python
  from string_schem import create_string_schematic
  create_string_schematic('1011X0', 'strings/yourstring.schem')
  ```
  - Only '0', '1', and 'X' are allowed in the string.
- **Features:**
  - Encodes each bit as a pair of repeaters in the schematic.
  - Pads to 256 bits if needed.

## How to Use
1. **Write your TM assembly program** in a `.as` file using the supported syntax.
2. **Assemble** the program:
   ```powershell
   python assembler.py yourprogram.as yourprogram.mc
   ```
3. **Generate the schematic**:
   ```powershell
   python schematic.py yourprogram.mc yourprogram.schem
   ```
4. **(Optional) Create a string schematic** for TM input:
   ```python
   from string_schem import create_string_schematic
   create_string_schematic('yourbinarystring', 'strings/yourstring.schem')
   ```
5. **Import the schematic** into Minecraft using WorldEdit or a compatible mod.
6. Make sure to execute: `//rotate 90` for the string generated with `string_schematic.py` and paste with `//paste -as`.

- ***Note**: The block where the TM schem `//paste -as` should be executed is the gray wool in the corner of the memory (purple wool). The string schem is a red wool block above all the memory and almost at one corner of the main memory (red blocks)*. **Explicit blocks when the world download is available**.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- [mcschematic](https://pypi.org/project/mcschematic/) Python library
  - Install with: `pip install mcschematic`
- Minecraft Java Edition 1.18.2 (for schematic compatibility)
- [WorldEdit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit) (for importing schematics)
